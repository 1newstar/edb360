Changelog
=========

v1702 (2017-01-13)
=====
1. Update Redundant Indexes(2) as per changes from david Kurtz
2. Section 7a now generates reports when AWR retention is less than 10 days. v1701.2 had introduced a new bug where retention less than 10 days would not produce any AWR/ADDM/ASH report
3. Added new section 4h Average Latency for Top 24 Wait Events
4. Fix 5a, 5b and 5c section where the number of AAS is incorrect due to bug here: (GREATEST(CAST(MAX(sample_time) AS DATE) - CAST(LAG(MAX(sample_time)) OVER (ORDER BY snap_id) AS DATE), 1) * 24 * 3600)


v1701 (2017-01-02)
=====
1. Increase font and chart size on edb360 and sqld360 to improve readability
2. AWR/ADDM/ASH reports add two more: max31 and max7. These two include a range that covers all the individual reports. So they are almost as large as 7 days and 31 days. There are cases where we can to see the big picture.
3. New reports on 3h: Sessions, Processes and Parallel Max Servers - Time Series
4. Added some columns to planx for DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT and similar views. Condition such columns to database version so we get more than the maximum common denominator
5. List of libraries which include DBMS_STATS shows not only the line where DBMS_STATS is referenced, but a few lines afterwards
6. Top timed events is promoted to use bar char instead of pie chart

v1622 (2016-12-27)
=====
1. Active Session History (ASH) - Top Signature includes now min and max SQL_ID
2. Granularity from hourly to per snap on all columns
3. Haxis shows now cores, threads and hosts
4. Adding num_rows and blocks to tables cached, on keep and on recycle (section 2a)
5. Adding seconds average and median to 3h. JDBC Idle connections for more than N hours and to JDBC Idle connections per JVM and Program
6. Pie charts include now percent on legend. Affects column 6 and section 5c
7. Added memory configuration at the bottom of 1a
8. Pie charts have now a hole
9. Skip SQL that would error on 10g
10. Refresh of sections 4f and 4g to include all waits and not just I/O waits
11. Database name can now be shown on index page as per edb360_conf_incl_dbname

v1621 (2016-12-03)
=====
1. Added Auto Tune Report
2. Added SQL Plan Directives
3. Enhanced AWR ASH pre-check
4. Added "All other Timed Clases" to 6a ASH bar char
5. Readme filename is now unique (for multi-threaded executions)
6. Add min sql_id to 2a SQL using Literals or many children (by COUNT) (GV$SQL)
7. Get alert log from diagnostic_dest on 12c

v1620 (2016-11-23)
=====
1. SQLd360 stops executing when it consumed all the time allocated by eDB360 (the *next* SQL ID will be ignored, the current one is let to complete)
2. All queries on dba_hist_active_sesss_history are now decorated with hints to use FTS and HJ. This to provide more consistent and predictable execution times when ASH is not getting purged and stats are not up to date.
3. Added awr_ash_pre_check.sql and verify_stats_wr_sys.sql scripts. If eDB360 is expected to take more than 8 hours the execution stops and waits for conformation to proceed.
4. SQL Trace is back on for eDB360 so we get a tkprof for the execution of eDB360 itself.
